# Conclusion

With this we have a basic GraphQL based API for a blog. Head on over
to [the github page](https://github.com/absinthe-graphql/absinthe_example) if
you want the final code.

We hope to expand this tutorial to include a comment system that will
acquaint you with Union types and Fragments in the coming days.

Head on over to the topic guides for further reading, and see
the [community page](community.html) for information
on how to get help, ask questions, or contribute!
