For now, see the [@absinthe/socket-apollo-link](https://github.com/absinthe-graphql/absinthe-socket/tree/master/packages/socket-apollo-link) package README, which includes examples showing how to configure Apollo to connect to an Absinthe GraphQL server over HTTP, Websockets, or using a hybrid configuration.
