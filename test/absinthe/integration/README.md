# Integration Tests

Before adding integration tests, please read:

- The module documentation for `Absinthe.IntegrationCase`, so you know
  the expected format for `.graphql` and `.exs` files.
- The contents of `test/absinthe/integration_test.exs`, which sets the
  default schema and contains custom assertion logic for some tests.
